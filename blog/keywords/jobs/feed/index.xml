<p class="head1" align="center">The  Tao  Of  Programming</p>
<p class="text1" align="center">Translated   By Geoffrey James</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Table of Contents</p>

<p>Book  2   &#8212;   The Ancient Masters</p>
<p>Book  3   &#8212;   Design</p>

<p>Book  8   &#8212;   Hardware and Software</p>
<p>Book  9   &#8212;   Epilogue</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">The Silent Void  &#8211; Book One</p>
<p align="left">                   Thus spake the master programmer:<br />
&#8220;When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap<br />
frame, it will be time for you to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">                                  1.1</p>
<p> Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone<br />
and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is<br />
the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it<br />
the Tao of Programming.</p>
<p>If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the<br />
operating system is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler<br />
is great, then the application is great. The user is pleased and their<br />
is harmony in the world.</p>
<p>The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of<br />
morning.</p>
<p>1.2</p>
<p>The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to<br />
the assembler.</p>
<p>The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now their are ten thousand<br />
languages.</p>
<p>Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses<br />
the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the<br />
Tao.</p>
<p>But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.</p>
<p>1.3</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.<br />
Therefore Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.</p>
<p>Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of<br />
time and space for there programs. Programmers that comprehend the<br />
Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>How could it be otherwise?</p>
<p>1.4</p>
<p>The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average<br />
programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish<br />
programmer is told about Tao and laughs at is.</p>
<p>If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.</p>
<p>The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to<br />
retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. Even a perfect<br />
program still has bugs.</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">The Ancient Masters &#8211; Book Two</p>
<p>                   Thus Spake the Master Programmer:<br />
&#8220;After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.1</p>
<p>The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom<br />
their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.</p>
<p>Aware, like a fox crossing the water. Alert, like a general on the<br />
battlefield. Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. Simple, like<br />
uncarved blocks of wood. Opaque , like black pools in darkened caves.</p>
<p>Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?</p>
<p>The answer exists only in Tao.</p>
<p>2.2</p>
<p>Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke<br />
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine,<br />
or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.3</p>
<p>A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software<br />
conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: &#8220;What<br />
sort of programmers work for other companies? They behaved badly and<br />
were unconcerned with appearances.  There hair was long and unkept<br />
and their clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed out hospitality<br />
suite and they made rude noises during my presentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manager said: &#8220;I should have never sent you to the conference.<br />
Those programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life<br />
absurd, an accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing<br />
limitations. Without a care, they live only for their programs. Why<br />
should they bother with social conventions?</p>
<p>They are alive within the Tao.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.4</p>
<p>A novice asked the Master: &#8220;Here is a programmer that never designs,<br />
documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him<br />
one of the best programmer in the world. Why is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Master replies: &#8220;That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has<br />
gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the<br />
system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone<br />
beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else<br />
sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his<br />
programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their<br />
purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.&#8221;</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Design &#8211; Book Three</p>
<p>                   Thus spake the Master Programmer:<br />
&#8220;When the program is being tested, it is too late to make design<br />
changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.1</p>
<p>There once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as<br />
he entered, the man told the guard at the door:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be<br />
forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.&#8221;</p>
<p>This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions<br />
of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man<br />
carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming<br />
quietly to himself.</p>
<p>When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,<br />
but nothing was to be found.</p>
<p>On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the<br />
guard saying: &#8220;I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will<br />
be even better.&#8221; So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to<br />
no avail.</p>
<p>On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his<br />
curiosity no longer. &#8220;Sir Thief,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am so perplexed, I<br />
cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are<br />
stealing?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled. &#8220;I am stealing ideas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>3.2</p>
<p>There once was a master programmer who wrote unstructured programs. A<br />
novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write<br />
unstructured programs. When the novice asked the master to evaluate<br />
his progress, the master criticized him for writing unstructured<br />
programs, saying &#8220;What is appropriate for the master is not<br />
appropriate for the novice. You must understand Tao before<br />
transcending structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.3</p>
<p>There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the<br />
warlord of Wu. The warlord asked the programmer: &#8220;Which is easier to<br />
design: an accounting package or an operating system?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An operating system,&#8221; replied the programmer.</p>
<p>The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. &#8220;Surely an<br />
accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating<br />
system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said the programmer, &#8220;when designing an accounting package,<br />
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different<br />
ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it<br />
must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not<br />
limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system,<br />
the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.<br />
This is why an operating system is easier to design.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. &#8220;That is all good and well, but<br />
which is easier to debug?&#8221;</p>
<p>The programmer made no reply.</p>
<p>3.4</p>
<p>A manager went to the master programmer and showed him the<br />
requirements document for a new application. The manager asked the<br />
master: &#8220;How long will it take to design this system if I assign five<br />
programmers to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take one year,&#8221; said the master promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we need this system immediately or even sooner! How long will it<br />
take if I assign ten programmers to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master programmer frowned. &#8220;In that case, it will take two<br />
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master programmer shrugged. &#8220;Then the design will never be<br />
completed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Coding &#8211; Book Four</p>
<p>                    Thus spake the master programmer:<br />
&#8220;A well-written program is its own heaven; a poorly-written<br />
program is its own hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>4.1</p>
<p>A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a<br />
string of pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be<br />
retained throughout. There should be neither too little or too much,<br />
neither needless loops nor useless variables, neither lack of<br />
structure nor overwhelming rigidity.</p>
<p>A program should follow the &#8216;Law of Least Astonishment&#8217;. What is this<br />
law? It is simply that the program should always respond to the user<br />
in the way that astonishes him least.</p>
<p>A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The<br />
program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward<br />
appearances.</p>
<p>If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of<br />
disorder and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite<br />
the program.</p>
<p>4.2</p>
<p>A novice asked the master: &#8220;I have a program that sometime runs and<br />
sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am<br />
totally baffled. What is the reason for this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master replied: &#8220;You are confused because you do not understand<br />
Tao. Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.<br />
Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?<br />
Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is prefect.</p>
<p>The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal.<br />
Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?&#8221; asked the<br />
novice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your program will then run correctly,&#8221; replied the master.</p>
<p>4.3</p>
<p>A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tao is embodied in all software &#8212; regardless of how<br />
insignificant,&#8221; said the master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?&#8221; asked the novice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; came the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the Tao in a video game?&#8221; continued the novice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is even in a video game,&#8221; said the master.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. &#8220;The lesson<br />
is over for today,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>4.4</p>
<p>Prince Wang&#8217;s programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon<br />
the keyboard. The program compiled without an error message, and the<br />
program ran like a gentle wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; the Prince exclaimed, &#8220;Your technique is faultless!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technique?&#8221; said the programmer turning from his terminal, &#8220;What I<br />
follow is Tao &#8212; beyond all techniques! When I first began to program<br />
I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three<br />
years I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now<br />
I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses<br />
are idle.  My spirit, free to work without plan, follows its own<br />
instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there<br />
are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch<br />
silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties<br />
vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit<br />
still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for<br />
a moment and then log off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prince Wang said, &#8220;Would that all of my programmers were as wise!&#8221;</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Maintenance &#8211; Book Five</p>
<p>                   Thus spake the master programmer:<br />
&#8220;Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to<br />
be maintained.&#8221;</p>
<p>5.1</p>
<p>A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.<br />
A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.<br />
Neither sound nor thoughts can travel through a vacuum.<br />
Software rots if not used.</p>
<p>These are great mysteries.</p>
<p>5.2</p>
<p>A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish<br />
the program on which he was working. &#8220;I will be finished tomorrow,&#8221;<br />
the programmer promptly replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are being unrealistic,&#8221; said the manager, &#8220;Truthfully,<br />
how long will it take?&#8221;</p>
<p>The programmer thought for a moment. &#8220;I have some features that I<br />
wish to add. This will take at least two weeks,&#8221; he finally said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even that is too much to expect,&#8221; insisted the manager, &#8220;I will be<br />
satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The programmer agreed to this.</p>
<p>Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his<br />
retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his<br />
terminal. He had been programming all night.</p>
<p>5.3</p>
<p>A novice programmer was once assigned to code simple financial<br />
package.</p>
<p>The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master<br />
reviewed his program, he discovered that it contained a screen<br />
editor, a set of generalized graphics routines, an artificial<br />
intelligence interface, but not the slightest mention of anything<br />
financial.</p>
<p>When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant.<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so impatient,&#8221; he said, &#8221; I&#8217;ll put in the financial stuff<br />
eventually.&#8221;</p>
<p>5.4</p>
<p>Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?<br />
Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?<br />
Does a good father allow a single child to starve?<br />
Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code?</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Management &#8211; Book Six</p>
<p>                   Thus spake the master programmer:<br />
&#8220;Let the programmer be many and the managers few &#8212; then all will<br />
be productive.&#8221;</p>
<p>6.1</p>
<p>When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games.<br />
When accountants talk of quarterly profits, the development budget<br />
is about to be cut. When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds<br />
are about to roll in.</p>
<p>Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.</p>
<p>When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored. When<br />
accountants make long-range plans, harmony and order are about to<br />
be restored. When senior scientists address the problems at hand,<br />
the problems will soon be solved.</p>
<p>Truly, this is the Tao of Programming.</p>
<p>6.2</p>
<p>Why are programmers non-productive? Because their time is wasted<br />
in meetings.</p>
<p>Why are programmers rebellious? Because the management interferes<br />
to much.</p>
<p>Why are the programmers resigning one by one? Because they are<br />
burnt out.</p>
<p>Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.</p>
<p>6.3</p>
<p>A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for<br />
him invented a new program that became popular and sold well. As<br />
a result, the manager retained his job.</p>
<p>The manager tries to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer<br />
refused it, saying, &#8220;I wrote the program because I thought it was<br />
an interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manager upon hearing this remarked, &#8220;This programmer, though he<br />
holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty<br />
of an employee. Lets promote him to the exalted position of<br />
management consultant!&#8221;</p>
<p>But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying,<br />
&#8220;I exist so that I can program. If I were promoted, I would do<br />
nothing but waste everyone&#8217;s time. Can I go now? I have a program<br />
that I&#8217;m working on.&#8221;</p>
<p>6.4</p>
<p>A manager went to his programmers and told them: &#8220;As regards to<br />
your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the<br />
morning and leave at five in the afternoon.&#8221; At this, all of them<br />
became angry and several resigned on the spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the manager said: &#8220;All right, in that case you may set your own<br />
working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule.&#8221;<br />
The programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work<br />
to the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Corporate Wisdom &#8211; Book Seven</p>
<p>                   Thus spake the master programmer:<br />
&#8220;You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but<br />
you can&#8217;t make him computer literate.&#8221;</p>
<p>7.1</p>
<p>A novice asked the master: &#8220;In the east there is a great tree-<br />
structure that men call &#8216;Corporate Headquarters&#8217;. It is bloated<br />
out of shape with vice presidents and accountants.  It issues a<br />
multitude of memos, each saying &#8216;Go, Hence!&#8217; or &#8216;Go, Hither!&#8217; and<br />
nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the<br />
branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity<br />
exist?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master replies: &#8220;You perceive this immense structure and are<br />
disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take<br />
amusement from its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the<br />
untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches?<br />
Why are you bothered by its uselessness?&#8221;</p>
<p>7.2</p>
<p>In the east there is a shark which is larger than all other fish.<br />
It changes into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky.<br />
When this bird moves across the land, it brings a message from<br />
Corporate Headquarters. This message it drops into the midst of the<br />
programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach. Then the<br />
bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns<br />
home.</p>
<p>The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he<br />
understands it not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the<br />
bird, for he fears its message. The master programmer continues to<br />
work at his terminal, for he does not know that the bird has come<br />
and gone.</p>
<p>7.3</p>
<p>The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for<br />
the master programmer to examine. The magician wheeled a large<br />
black box into the master&#8217;s office while the master waited in<br />
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,&#8221;<br />
began the magician, &#8220;ergonomically designed with a proprietary<br />
operating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of<br />
the art user interfaces. It took my assistants several hundred man<br />
years to construct. Is it not amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The master raised his eyebrows slightly. &#8220;It is indeed amazing,&#8221; he<br />
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporate Headquarters has commanded,&#8221; continued the magician,<br />
&#8220;that everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.<br />
Do you agree to this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the master, &#8221; I will have it transported to the<br />
data center immediately!&#8221; And the magician returned to his tower,<br />
well pleased.</p>
<p>Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master<br />
programmer and said, &#8220;I cannot find the listing for my new program.<br />
Do you know where it might be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the master, &#8220;the listings are stacked on the platform<br />
in the data center.&#8221;</p>
<p>7.4</p>
<p>The master programmer moves form program to program without fear.<br />
No change in management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if<br />
the project is cancelled. Why is this? He is filled with Tao.</p>
<p class="head1" align="center">Hardware and Software &#8211; Book Eight</p>
<p>                   Thus spake the master programmer:<br />
&#8220;Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software,<br />
hardware is useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>8.1</p>
<p>A novice asked the master: &#8220;I perceive that one computer company is<br />
much larger than all others. It towers above its competition like a<br />
giant among dwarfs. Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire<br />
business. Why is this so?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master replied, &#8220;Why do you ask such foolish questions? That<br />
company is large because it is large. If it only made hardware,<br />
nobody would buy it. If it only made software, nobody would use it.<br />
If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a servant.<br />
But because it combines all of these things, people think it one of<br />
the gods! By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>8.2</p>
<p>A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day. The master<br />
noted the novice&#8217;s preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.<br />
&#8220;Excuse me&#8221;, he said, &#8220;may I examine it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master. I<br />
see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium<br />
and Hard&#8221;, said the master. &#8220;Yet every such device has another level<br />
of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be<br />
conquered by the human.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, great master&#8221;, implored the novice, &#8220;how does one find this<br />
mysterious settings?&#8221;</p>
<p>The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under<br />
foot.  And suddenly the novice was enlightened.</p>
<p>8.3</p>
<p>There was once a programmer who worked upon microprocessors. &#8220;Look at<br />
how well off I am here,&#8221; he said to a mainframe programmer who came<br />
to visit, &#8220;I have my own operating system and file storage device. I<br />
do not have to share my resources with anyone. The software is self-<br />
consistant and easy-to-use. Why do you not quit your present job and<br />
join me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his<br />
friend, saying &#8220;The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in<br />
the midst of the data center. Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a<br />
great ocean of machinery. The software is as multifaceted as a<br />
diamond, and as convoluted as a primeval jungle. The programs, each<br />
unique, move through the system like a swift-flowing river. That is<br />
why I am happy where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The microcomputer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the<br />
two programmers remained friends until the end of their days.</p>
<p>8.4</p>
<p>Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said: &#8220;You<br />
are Yin and I am Yang. If we travel together we will become famous<br />
and earn vast sums of money.&#8221; And so the set forth together, thinking<br />
to conquer the world.</p>
<p>Presently they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rage and<br />
hobbled along propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them: &#8220;The<br />
Tao lies beyond Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of<br />
water. It does not seek fame, therefore nobody knows its presence. It<br />
does not seek fortune, for it is complete within itself. It exists<br />
beyond space and time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Software and Hardware , ashamed, returned to their homes.</p>

<p>                   Thus spake the Master Programmer:<br />
&#8220;Time for you to leave.&#8221;</p>
